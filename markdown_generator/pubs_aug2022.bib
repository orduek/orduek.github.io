  abstract  = "ABSTRACTBackground: The most used questionnaires for PTSD
               screening in adults were developed in English. Although many of
               these questionnaires were translated into other languages, the
               procedures used to translate them and to evaluate their
               reliability and validity have not been consistently documented.
               This comprehensive scoping review aimed to compile the currently
               available translated and evaluated questionnaires used for PTSD
               screening, and highlight important gaps in the
               literature.Objective: This review aimed to map the availability
               of translated and evaluated screening questionnaires for
               posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) for adults.Methods: All
               peer-reviewed studies in which a PTSD screening questionnaire
               for adults was translated, and which reported at least one
               result of a qualitative and /or quantitative evaluation
               procedure were included. The literature was searched using
               Embase, MEDLINE, and APA PsycInfo, citation searches and
               contributions from study team members. There were no
               restrictions regarding the target languages of the translations.
               Data on the translation procedure, the qualitative evaluation,
               the quantitative evaluation (dimensionality of the
               questionnaire, reliability, and performance), and open access
               were extracted.Results: A total of 866 studies were screened, of
               which 126 were included. Collectively, 128 translations of 12
               different questionnaires were found. Out of these, 105 (83.3\%)
               studies used a forward and backward translation procedure, 120
               (95.2\%) assessed the reliability of the translated
               questionnaire, 60 (47.6\%) the dimensionality, 49 (38.9\%) the
               performance, and 42 (33.3\%) used qualitative evaluation
               procedures. Thirty-four questionnaires (27.0\%) were either
               freely available or accessible on request.Conclusions: The
               analyses conducted and the description of the methods and
               results varied substantially, making a quality assessment
               impractical. Translations into languages spoken in middle- or
               low-income countries were underrepresented. In addition, only a
               small proportion of all translated questionnaires were
               available. Given the need for freely accessible translations, an
               online repository was developed.HIGHLIGHTS We mapped the
               availability of translated PTSD screening questionnaires.The
               quality of the translation and validation processes is very
               heterogenous.We created a repository for translated, validated

              delirium prediction models. For this purpose, we used data of all
              patients 18 years or older which were hospitalized for more than
              a day between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2018, at a single
              tertiary teaching hospital in Zurich, Switzerland. A total of
              48,840 patients met inclusion criteria. 18,873 (38.6\%) were
              excluded due to missing data. Mean age (SD) of the included
              29,967 patients was 71.1 (12.2) years and 12,231 (40.8\%) were
              women. Delirium was assessed with the Delirium Observation Scale
              (DOS) with a total score of 3 or greater indicating that a
              patient is at risk for delirium. Additional measures included
              structured data collected for nursing process planning and
              demographic characteristics. The performance of the machine
              learning models was assessed using the area under the receiver
              operating characteristic curve (AUC). The training set consisted
              of 21,147 patients (mean age 71.1 (12.1) years; 8,630 (40.8\%)
              women|) including 233,024 observations with 16,167 (6.9\%)
              positive DOS screens. The test set comprised 8,820 patients
              (median age 71.1 (12.4) years; 3,601 (40.8\%) women) with 91,026
              observations with 5,445 (6.0\%) positive DOS screens. Overall,
              the gradient boosting machine model performed best with an AUC of
              0.933 (95\% CI, 0.929 - 0.936). In conclusion, machine learning
              models based only on structured nursing data can reliably predict
              patients at risk for delirium in an acute care setting.
              Prediction models, using existing data collection processes,

              these reflect pre-trauma vulnerability traits or acquired
              post-trauma consequences of the disorder. Here, we conducted a
              longitudinal panel study of adult civilian trauma survivors
              admitted to a general hospital emergency department (ED). One
              hundred eligible participants (mean age = 32.97 $\pm$ 10.97, n =
              56 females) completed both clinical interviews and structural MRI
              scans at 1-, 6-, and 14-months after ED admission (alias T1, T2,
              and T3). While all participants met PTSD diagnosis at T1, only n
              = 29 still met PTSD diagnosis at T3 (a ``non-Remission'' Group),
              while n = 71 did not (a ``Remission'' Group). Bayesian multilevel
              modeling analysis showed robust evidence for smaller right
              hippocampus volume (P+ of ~0.014) and moderate evidence for
              larger left amygdala volume (P+ of ~0.870) at T1 in the
              ``non-Remission'' group, compared to the ``Remission'' group.
              Subregion analysis further demonstrated robust evidence for
              smaller volume in the subiculum and right CA1 hippocampal
              subregions (P+ of ~0.021-0.046) in the ``non-Remission'' group.
              No time-dependent volumetric changes (T1 to T2 to T3) were
              observed across all participants or between groups. Results
              support the ``vulnerability trait'' hypothesis, suggesting that
              lower initial volumes of specific hippocampus subregions are
              associated with non-remitting PTSD. The stable volume of all
              hippocampal and amygdala subregions does not support the idea of
              consequential, progressive, stress-related atrophy during the
              first critical year following trauma exposure.",

              than individual CPT, however, evidence regarding real-world
              effectiveness is limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective,
              observational, comparative effectiveness study including veterans
              that received at least eight sessions of group CPT, individual
              CPT, or individual PE, and were discharged from PTSD residential
              treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs between 1 October
              2015, and 30 September 2020. PTSD symptom severity was assessed
              with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and treatments
              delivered in a group (CPT) or individual (CPT or PE) setting were
              compared at discharge and 4-month post-discharge follow-up.
              RESULTS: Of 6735 veterans, 3888 [653 women (17\%), median (IQR)
              age 45 (35-55) years] received individual and 2847 [206 women
              (7.2\%), median (IQR) age 42 (34-54)] received group therapy. At
              discharge, improvement in PTSD severity was statistically greater
              among those treated individually (mean difference on the PCL-5,
              2.55 (95\% CI 1.61-3.49); p = <0.001]. However, the difference
              was smaller than the minimal clinically important difference of
              7.9 points. The groups did not differ significantly at 4-month
              follow-up [mean difference on the PCL-5, 0.37 (95\% CI -0.86 to
              1.60); p = 0.551]. CONCLUSION: Group CPT was associated with a
              slightly smaller reduction of PTSD symptom severity than
              individual CPT or PE in veterans at the end of residential
              treatment. There were no differences at 4-month follow-up.",

  abstract = "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with altered
              pain perception, namely increased pain threshold and higher pain
              response. While pain consists of physiological and affective
              components, affective components are often overlooked. Similar
              patterns of increased threshold-high response in PTSD were shown
              in response to emotional stimuli, i.e., emotional numbing. As
              both emotional numbing and pain processing are modulated by the
              amygdala, we aimed to examine whether individuals diagnosed with
              PTSD show lower amygdala activation to pain compared with combat
              controls, and whether the amygdala responses to pain correlates
              with emotional numbing. To do so, two independent samples of
              veterans (original study: 44 total (20 PTSD); conceptual
              replication study: 40 total (20 PTSD)) underwent threat
              conditioning, where a conditioned stimulus (CS+; visual stimulus)
              was paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US; electric-shock).
              We contrasted the amygdala activity to the CS + US pairing with
              the CS+ presented alone and correlated it with emotional numbing
              severity. In both samples, the PTSD group showed a robust
              reduction in amygdala reactivity to shock compared to the Combat
              Controls group. Furthermore, amygdala activation was negatively
              correlated with emotional numbing severity. These patterns were
              unique to the amygdala, and did not appear in comparison to a
              control region, the insula, a pivotal region for the processing
              of pain. To conclude, amygdala response to pain is lower in
              individuals with PTSD, and is associated with emotional numbing
              symptoms. Lower amygdala reactivity to mild pain may contribute
              to the ``all-or-none'' reaction to stressful situations often
              observed in PTSD.",

               system, including variants in the cannabinoid-1 receptor gene (
               CNR1), in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic stress disorder
               (PTSD). The synonymous G1359A variant (rs1049353) in the CNR1
               gene has been linked to PTSD in individuals exposed to childhood
               abuse. In this study, the effects of the rs1049353 genotype and
               childhood abuse on overall PTSD symptoms, as well as PTSD
               symptom clusters were examined in order to examine how this
               interaction relates to the phenotypic expression of this
               disorder. Method Data were analyzed from 1,372 Caucasian U.S.
               veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience
               in Veterans Study. Multivariable analyses were conducted to
               evaluate the association between rs1049353 genotype, childhood
               abuse, and their interaction in relation to PTSD symptoms.
               Results A significant interaction between rs1049353 genotype and
               childhood abuse was observed, with A allele carriers with
               histories of childhood abuse reporting greater severity of PTSD
               symptoms, most notably anxious arousal, relative to G/G
               homozygotes. Significant main effects of childhood abuse on
               overall PTSD symptoms, and re-experiencing, emotional numbing,
               and dysphoric arousal symptom clusters, as well as of A allele
               carrier status on anxious arousal symptoms were observed.
               Conclusions Results of this study replicate prior work and
               suggest that the rs1049353-by-childhood abuse interaction is
               particularly associated with the manifestation of anxious
               arousal symptoms of PTSD. Taken together, these findings

  abstract = "Abstract Background In recent years, a new framework for
              analyzing and understanding posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
              was introduced; the network approach. Up until now, network
              analysis studies of PTSD were largely conducted on small to
              medium sample sizes (N?<?1,000), which might be a possible cause
              of variability in main findings. Moreover, only a limited number
              of network studies investigated comorbidity. Methods In this
              study, we utilized a large sample to conduct a network analysis
              of 17 symptoms of PTSD (DSM-IV), and compared it to the result of
              a second network consisting of symptoms of PTSD and depression
              (based on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Our sample
              consisted of 502,036 treatment-seeking veterans, out of which
              158,139 had fully completed the assessment of symptoms of PTSD
              and a subsample of 32,841 with valid PCL and PHQ-9 that was
              administered within 14 days or less. Results Analyses found that
              in the PTSD network, the most central symptoms were feeling
              distant or cut off from others, followed by feeling very upset
              when reminded of the event, and repeated disturbing memories or
              thoughts of the event. In the combined network, we found that
              concentration difficulties and anhedonia are two of the five most
              central symptoms. Conclusion Our findings replicate the
              centrality of intrusion symptoms in PTSD symptoms' network.
              Taking into account the large sample and high stability of the
              network structure, we believe our study can answer some of the
              criticism regarding stability of cross-sectional network

               we analyzed data from 154,953 veterans newly diagnosed with PTSD

               anxiolytic/hypnotic and antipsychotic medications. Binomial
               regressions examined the role of these factors in early
               discontinuation (within 30 days). Results revealed that 71.8\%
               of veterans discontinued medication treatment within 180 days,
               and 34.6\% within 30 days. The strongest risk factors associated

  abstract = "According to the hypersensitive behavioral approach system (BAS)
              model of bipolar disorder (BP), hypersensitivity of the BAS is a
              trait that should be present even in the euthymic state. This
              would be expected to result in increased anger and reward
              sensitivity, both of which are related to the approach system.
              This study examined these predictions through the use of tasks
              that assess different aspects of the BAS: reward sensitivity,
              anger and impulsivity. These characteristics were assessed using
              the probabilistic classification task (PCT), ultimatum game (UG)
              and single key impulsivity paradigm (SKIP), respectively.
              Participants were euthymic adult bipolar disorder patients (BP;
              N=40) and healthy controls (HC; N=41). In the UG, all
              participants showed the standard pattern of rejecting overtly
              unfair offers and accepting clearly fair offers; however, BPs
              rejected more of the moderately unfair offers than did HCs. BP
              and HC participants did not differ on their ability to learn, but
              did show different patterns of learning from reward and
              punishment. Learning for reward and punishment were negatively
              correlated in the BP group, suggesting that individuals could
              learn well either from reward or punishment, but not both. No
              correlation was found between these forms of learning in the HC
              group. BP patients show signs of their disorder even in the
              euthymic state, as seen by the dysbalance between reward and
              punishment learning and their residual anger in the UG.",
