  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Accumulating data suggest that the structure of
               posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms may be more nuanced
               than proposed by prevailing nosological models. Emerging theory
               further suggests that an 8-factor model with separate internally-
               (e.g., flashbacks) and externally- (e.g., trauma cue-related
               emotional reactivity) generated intrusive symptoms may best
               represent PTSD symptoms. To date, however, scarce research has
               evaluated the fit of this model and whether index traumas are
               differentially associated with it in populations at high risk for
               trauma exposure, such as military veterans. METHODS: Data were
               analyzed from a nationally representative sample of 3847
               trauma-exposed U.S. veterans who participated in the National
               Health and Resilience in Veterans Study. Confirmatory factor
               analyses were conducted to evaluate the fit of a novel 8-factor
               model of PTSD symptoms relative to 4-factor DSM-5 and
               empirically-supported 7-factor hybrid models. RESULTS: The
               8-factor model fit the data significantly better than the
               7-factor hybrid and 4-factor DSM-5 models. Combat exposure and
               harming others were more strongly associated with
               internally-generated intrusions, while interpersonal violence and
               disaster/accident showed stronger significant associations with
               externally-generated intrusions. LIMITATIONS: The 8-factor model
               requires validation in non-veteran and more diverse
               trauma-exposed populations, as well as with
               clinician-administered interviews. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this
               study provide support for a novel 8-factor model of PTSD symptoms
               that is characterized by separate internally- and
               externally-generated intrusions. They also suggest that certain
               index traumas may lead to differential expression of these
               symptoms.",

               N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist,
               elicits dissociation in individuals with posttraumatic stress
               disorder (PTSD), who also often suffer from chronic dissociative
               symptoms in daily life. These debilitating symptoms have not only
               been linked to worse PTSD trajectories, but also to increased
               resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between medial
               prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and amygdala, supporting the
               conceptualization of dissociation as emotion overmodulation. Yet,
               as studies were observational, causal evidence is lacking.
               OBJECTIVES: The present randomized controlled pilot study
               examines the effect of ketamine, a dissociative drug, on RSFC
               between mPFC subregions and amygdala in individuals with PTSD.
               METHODS: Twenty-six individuals with PTSD received either
               ketamine (0.5mg/kg; n = 12) or the control drug midazolam
               (0.045mg/kg; n = 14) during functional magnetic resonance imaging
               (fMRI). RSFC between amygdala and mPFC subregions, i.e.,
               ventromedial PFC (vmPFC), dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) and
               anterior-medial PFC (amPFC), was assessed at baseline and during
               intravenous drug infusion. RESULTS: Contrary to pre-registered
               predictions, ketamine did not promote a greater increase in RSFC
               between amygdala and mPFC subregions from baseline to infusion
               compared to midazolam. Instead, ketamine elicited a stronger
               transient decrease in vmPFC-amygdala RSFC compared to midazolam.
               CONCLUSIONS: A dissociative drug did not increase fronto-limbic
               RSFC in individuals with PTSD. These preliminary experimental
               findings contrast with prior correlative findings and call for
               further exploration and, potentially, a more differentiated view
               on the neurobiological underpinning of dissociative phenomena in
               PTSD.",

              stress disorder (PTSD). Since the initial characterization of
              PTSD in DSM-III, emotional numbing symptoms have been revised and
              grouped under different symptom clusters (avoidance in DSM-IV,
              negative alterations in cognitions, and mood in DSM-5). Previous
              studies have found emotional numbing symptoms to be associated
              with greater PTSD severity, functional impairment, and worse
              treatment outcomes. Although considered an important feature,
              some argue that emotional numbing symptoms may simply reflect the
              manifestation of major depressive disorder (MDD) symptoms rather
              than be an inherent part of the PTSD phenotype. Here, we
              evaluated this question using two different data sets (N1 = 142;
              CAPS-5, N2 = 163; CAPS-4) of trauma-exposed individuals. First,
              we evaluated the unique variance of emotional numbing explained
              by diagnosis as binary variables (i.e., having PTSD, MDD, or
              both) and the severity of symptoms. Second, we examined the
              relative importance of each PTSD symptom in relation to emotional
              numbing symptoms. Results revealed that PTSD had a distinct
              contribution to the variance explaining emotional numbing
              symptoms above and beyond MDD. These findings suggest that
              emotional numbing should not be conceptualized as a simple
              manifestation of MDD symptoms. Rather, this symptom cluster may
              be a unique feature of PTSD that should be addressed within the

              these reflect pre-trauma vulnerability traits or acquired
              post-trauma consequences of the disorder. Here, we conducted a

              admitted to a general hospital emergency department (ED). One
              hundred eligible participants (mean age = 32.97 $\pm$ 10.97, n =
              56 females) completed both clinical interviews and structural MRI
              scans at 1-, 6-, and 14-months after ED admission (alias T1, T2,
              and T3). While all participants met PTSD diagnosis at T1, only n
              = 29 still met PTSD diagnosis at T3 (a ``non-Remission'' Group),
              while n = 71 did not (a ``Remission'' Group). Bayesian multilevel
              modeling analysis showed robust evidence for smaller right
              hippocampus volume (P+ of ~0.014) and moderate evidence for
              larger left amygdala volume (P+ of ~0.870) at T1 in the
              ``non-Remission'' group, compared to the ``Remission'' group.
              Subregion analysis further demonstrated robust evidence for
              smaller volume in the subiculum and right CA1 hippocampal
              subregions (P+ of ~0.021-0.046) in the ``non-Remission'' group.

              lower initial volumes of specific hippocampus subregions are
              associated with non-remitting PTSD. The stable volume of all
              hippocampal and amygdala subregions does not support the idea of
              consequential, progressive, stress-related atrophy during the
              first critical year following trauma exposure.",

              than individual CPT, however, evidence regarding real-world
              effectiveness is limited. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective,
              observational, comparative effectiveness study including veterans
              that received at least eight sessions of group CPT, individual
              CPT, or individual PE, and were discharged from PTSD residential
              treatment at the Department of Veterans Affairs between 1 October
              2015, and 30 September 2020. PTSD symptom severity was assessed
              with the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5) and treatments
              delivered in a group (CPT) or individual (CPT or PE) setting were
              compared at discharge and 4-month post-discharge follow-up.
              RESULTS: Of 6735 veterans, 3888 [653 women (17\%), median (IQR)
              age 45 (35-55) years] received individual and 2847 [206 women
              (7.2\%), median (IQR) age 42 (34-54)] received group therapy. At
              discharge, improvement in PTSD severity was statistically greater
              among those treated individually (mean difference on the PCL-5,
              2.55 (95\% CI 1.61-3.49); p = <0.001]. However, the difference
              was smaller than the minimal clinically important difference of
              7.9 points. The groups did not differ significantly at 4-month

              response. While pain consists of physiological and affective
              components, affective components are often overlooked. Similar
              patterns of increased threshold-high response in PTSD were shown
              in response to emotional stimuli, i.e., emotional numbing. As
              both emotional numbing and pain processing are modulated by the
              amygdala, we aimed to examine whether individuals diagnosed with
              PTSD show lower amygdala activation to pain compared with combat
              controls, and whether the amygdala responses to pain correlates
              with emotional numbing. To do so, two independent samples of
              veterans (original study: 44 total (20 PTSD); conceptual
              replication study: 40 total (20 PTSD)) underwent threat
              conditioning, where a conditioned stimulus (CS+; visual stimulus)
              was paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US; electric-shock).
              We contrasted the amygdala activity to the CS + US pairing with
              the CS+ presented alone and correlated it with emotional numbing
              severity. In both samples, the PTSD group showed a robust
              reduction in amygdala reactivity to shock compared to the Combat
              Controls group. Furthermore, amygdala activation was negatively
              correlated with emotional numbing severity. These patterns were
              unique to the amygdala, and did not appear in comparison to a
              control region, the insula, a pivotal region for the processing
              of pain. To conclude, amygdala response to pain is lower in
              individuals with PTSD, and is associated with emotional numbing
              symptoms. Lower amygdala reactivity to mild pain may contribute
              to the ``all-or-none'' reaction to stressful situations often
              observed in PTSD.",

               Results A significant interaction between rs1049353 genotype and
               childhood abuse was observed, with A allele carriers with
               histories of childhood abuse reporting greater severity of PTSD
               symptoms, most notably anxious arousal, relative to G/G
               homozygotes. Significant main effects of childhood abuse on

              medium sample sizes (N?<?1,000), which might be a possible cause
              of variability in main findings. Moreover, only a limited number
              of network studies investigated comorbidity. Methods In this
              study, we utilized a large sample to conduct a network analysis
              of 17 symptoms of PTSD (DSM-IV), and compared it to the result of
              a second network consisting of symptoms of PTSD and depression
              (based on Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]). Our sample
              consisted of 502,036 treatment-seeking veterans, out of which
              158,139 had fully completed the assessment of symptoms of PTSD
              and a subsample of 32,841 with valid PCL and PHQ-9 that was
              administered within 14 days or less. Results Analyses found that
              in the PTSD network, the most central symptoms were feeling
              distant or cut off from others, followed by feeling very upset
              when reminded of the event, and repeated disturbing memories or
              thoughts of the event. In the combined network, we found that
              concentration difficulties and anhedonia are two of the five most
              central symptoms. Conclusion Our findings replicate the
              centrality of intrusion symptoms in PTSD symptoms' network.
              Taking into account the large sample and high stability of the
              network structure, we believe our study can answer some of the
              criticism regarding stability of cross-sectional network
              structures.",

               regarding the prevalence and determinants of discontinuation of
               psychotropic medication in this population. To address this gap,
               we analyzed data from 154,953 veterans newly diagnosed with PTSD
               who were seeking VA treatment and followed them for one year to
               identify the prevalence and determinants of medication
               discontinuation. A hazard analysis was conducted to identify
               factors associated with discontinuation of antidepressant,
               anxiolytic/hypnotic and antipsychotic medications. Binomial
               regressions examined the role of these factors in early
               discontinuation (within 30 days). Results revealed that 71.8\%
               of veterans discontinued medication treatment within 180 days,
               and 34.6\% within 30 days. The strongest risk factors associated
               with discontinuing medication were no engagement in adjunctive
               psychotherapy and prescription of a single medication. Older
               veterans were less likely than younger veterans to discontinue
               treatment. Similar risk factors were associated with medication
               discontinuation in the first 30 days. These results suggest that
               psychiatric comorbidities, age, and race are key risk factors
               for poor medication adherence, and underscore the importance of
               early intervention and patient education in promoting adherence
               to pharmacotherapy for PTSD.",

  abstract = "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating
              psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 6.1\% in the
              general adult population. Clinical guidelines for the treatment
              of PTSD suggest the use of trauma-focused psychotherapies such as
              prolonged exposure (PE) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT).
              As a second-level intervention, these guidelines suggest the use
              of psychotropic medications, mainly selective serotonin reuptake
              inhibitors (SSRIs). To date, however, studies have shown that
              both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatments have
              limited efficacy, with remission rates around 40--70\% and
              dropout rates of up to 50\%. This paper reviews a new and
              emerging treatment approach of medication-augmented psychotherapy
              for PTSD, with an emphasis on augmenting prolonged exposure
              therapy (PE) with sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion. Based on
              animal and human research on fear extinction and memory
              reconsolidation, neurobiological changes that emerge following a
              ketamine infusion can enhance learning and thus benefit

  abstract = "According to the hypersensitive behavioral approach system (BAS)
              model of bipolar disorder (BP), hypersensitivity of the BAS is a
              trait that should be present even in the euthymic state. This
              would be expected to result in increased anger and reward
              sensitivity, both of which are related to the approach system.
              This study examined these predictions through the use of tasks
              that assess different aspects of the BAS: reward sensitivity,
              anger and impulsivity. These characteristics were assessed using
              the probabilistic classification task (PCT), ultimatum game (UG)
              and single key impulsivity paradigm (SKIP), respectively.
              Participants were euthymic adult bipolar disorder patients (BP;
              N=40) and healthy controls (HC; N=41). In the UG, all
              participants showed the standard pattern of rejecting overtly
              unfair offers and accepting clearly fair offers; however, BPs
              rejected more of the moderately unfair offers than did HCs. BP
              and HC participants did not differ on their ability to learn, but
              did show different patterns of learning from reward and
              punishment. Learning for reward and punishment were negatively
              correlated in the BP group, suggesting that individuals could
              learn well either from reward or punishment, but not both. No
              correlation was found between these forms of learning in the HC
              group. BP patients show signs of their disorder even in the
              euthymic state, as seen by the dysbalance between reward and
