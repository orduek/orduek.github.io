## About Me
My Name is Or Duek. I am an assistant professor (Senior Lecturer) at the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Community Health Sciences at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. I am also an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine.

Until recently, I have worked as a research associate with Drs. Ilan Harpaz-Rotem [lab page](https://www.ptsdstresslab.org/) and Ifat Levy [lab page](https://levydecisionlab.org/).

## Main Research Focus
=======================

My research tries to unravel the effect of exposure to stress on the individual and the environment. Moreover, I'm interested in the symptomatology and brain mechanism that underlies post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its mechanism of change.
