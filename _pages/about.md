## About Me

My Name is Or Duek. I am an assistant professor (Senior Lecturer) at the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Community Health Sciences at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev and an Adjunct Assistant Professor at the Department of Psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine.

## Main Research Focus

My research tries to unravel the effect of exposure to stress on the individual and the environment. One of the most prevalent disorders following a traumatic event is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). My interest focuses on the intersection Public Health and Psychology. As such, I'm interested in the symptomatology and brain mechanism that underlies post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and its mechanism of change, as well as the mental and behavioral effects of stress in general.
