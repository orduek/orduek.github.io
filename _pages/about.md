## About Me

A clinical psychologist, Assistant Professor (Senior Lecturer), in the Department of Epidemiology, Biostatistics, and Community Health Sciences at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev. Additionally, I serve as an Adjunct Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychiatry at Yale University School of Medicine.

## Main Research Focus

My research is centered around understanding the epidemiological implications of stress exposure on individuals and communities. A common sequela to traumatic events is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a condition that has significant public health ramifications. My primary focus lies at the intersection of Epidemiology and Psychology. I am keen on studying the symptomatology and neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD, its mechanisms of progression, as well as the cognitive and behavioral consequences of stress exposure in broader populations. This aligns with a public health perspective, promoting understanding of the prevalence, distribution, and control of PTSD and stress-related disorders in the population.
