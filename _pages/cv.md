Clinical Work
=============

I have worked at Soroka University Medical center at The Vivian and Seymour Milstein Family Trauma Recovery Center for Children and Adolescents as a senior clinical psychologist. The center focus on treating children and adolescents after a traumatic event including terror attacks, car accidents, domestic violence etc. As part of my work I supervised and mentored other workers and psychology students on both treatment and psycho-diagnostics tools. Currently I conduct psychotherapy as part of a study, using short term Prolonged Exposure (PE) based protocol to treat PTSD.
